<p align="start">ToolConect is a responsive project built for people to rent equipment and tools in Berlin at an affordable price for home use. It was developed as part of my introduction to Ruby on Rails during my web development bootcamp, showcasing my knowledge in the language. We had one week to create this project.</p>
